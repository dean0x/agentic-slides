# Compact Status - 2025-11-28

**Focus**: Comprehensive code review of multi-presentation template refactor

**Key Accomplishments**:
1. Ran 7 specialized audit sub-agents (Security, Performance, Architecture, Tests, Complexity, Dependencies, Documentation)
2. Created 29 PR comments on GitHub PR #1 with actionable feedback
3. Created 21 tech debt items tracked in GitHub Issue #2
4. Generated synthesized review summary with merge recommendation

**Critical Decisions**:
- BLOCK MERGE - 6 CRITICAL issues must be fixed first
- Dead code removal required: Slide.jsx, slides.js, src/assets/
- Mermaid.js must be lazy-loaded (500KB+ bundle impact)
- Test framework required before merge (Vitest recommended)
- README needs rewrite for new architecture

**Next Priority Actions**:
1. Delete dead code (`rm src/components/Slide.jsx src/data/slides.js && rm -rf src/assets/`)
2. Lazy-load Mermaid.js via dynamic import
3. Install Vitest + Testing Library, add minimum tests
4. Update README.md to describe multi-presentation template
5. Re-run `/devflow:code-review` to verify fixes

**Critical Issues**:
| Issue | Location | Fix |
|-------|----------|-----|
| Dead code | Slide.jsx, slides.js | Delete files |
| Dead assets | src/assets/ | Delete directory |
| Bundle size | SlideRenderer.jsx:3 | Lazy-load Mermaid |
| No tests | package.json | Add Vitest |
| Outdated README | README.md | Rewrite |
| Mermaid duplication | SlideRenderer + VisualPanel | Create shared hook |

**Audit Scores**:
- Security: 7/10 (approved with conditions)
- Performance: 5/10 (BLOCK)
- Architecture: 6.8/10 (BLOCK)
- Tests: 0/10 (BLOCK)
- Complexity: 5/10 (review required)
- Dependencies: 7/10 (approved with conditions)
- Documentation: 5/10 (review required)

**Context Notes**:
Code review completed. PR #1 is blocked from merge. 8 audit report files in `.docs/audits/feature-multi-presentation-template/`. Review summary provides ordered action plan. Estimated fix effort: 2-4 hours for CRITICAL items.
