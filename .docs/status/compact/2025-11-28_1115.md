# Compact Status - 2025-11-28

**Focus**: Refactor single-presentation app to multi-presentation template

**Key Accomplishments**:
1. Added React Router with home page (presentation grid) and viewer routes
2. Created JSON-based slide format with icon resolver and theme system
3. Migrated 69 Gen AI slides to new JSON format, split monolithic Slide.jsx into modular components

**Critical Decisions**:
- JSON for slides (not JS/MDX) - cleaner separation, easier editing
- Icon resolver pattern - maps string names to Lucide components at runtime
- Context API for state - sufficient for slide navigation, no external deps needed

**Next Priority Actions**:
1. Delete old `Slide.jsx` and `slides.js` after confirming new system works
2. Create second example presentation to validate template
3. Merge PR to main

**Critical Issues**:
- None blocking
- Tech debt: Old slide components still in codebase (unused)

**Key Files Modified**:
- `src/App.jsx` - Router setup
- `src/presentations/gen-ai-hackathon/slides.json` - 69 slides in JSON
- `src/components/SlideRenderer.jsx` - New slide renderer
- `src/context/PresentationContext.jsx` - State management
- `src/pages/HomePage.jsx` + `PresentationViewer.jsx` - New pages

**Context Notes**:
Major architectural refactor complete. The app now supports multiple presentations via JSON files. Each presentation has its own folder in `src/presentations/` with a `slides.json` file and assets in `public/presentations/{id}/assets/`. Register new presentations in `registry.js`.
